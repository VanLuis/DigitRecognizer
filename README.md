This project is aimed to offer an example of the used of matlab C interface, and the matlab neural network toolbox.

It is a complement of several posts I published in my blog (in spanish).

1. Backprogation neural network example: https://poncos.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/matlab-ejemplo-backpropagation/
2. Matlab neural network toolbox: https://poncos.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/matlab-toolbox-de-redes-neuronales/ 
3. Matlab interface COM: https://poncos.wordpress.com/2008/08/03/matlab-interfaz-com/

This probject can be used as an example about how to use the C API available with matlab to get access to its toolboxes and environment from an C applicaiton.
And it can be used as example about how to apply neural network to machine learning problems. Concretely this project apply a
backpropagation neural network to recognied handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

This project shows how to apply the typical steps necesary for any system of this characteristics.

1. Data preprocessing. 
2. Neural network application to the preprocessed data.
3. Data postprocessing and results generation.
